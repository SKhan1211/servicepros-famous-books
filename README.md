### Brief Overview

This project is my coding challenge submission to the Service Pro's software engineering team. It is a full-stack bookstore application that allows users to bookmark books and "buy" books. The following technologies are utilized to build this project:
* Ruby on Rails as a backend web framework for creating/managing API endpoints
* React.js to handle frontend views
* Redux for local state management
* PostgreSQL as the database
